# Pure Components vs Standard Components vs Functional Stateless Components

- A project just to test the rendering of each react component type.


## Standard Component
- Will render on load and every time the state is set.

## Functional Stateless Component
- Will render similar to a standard Component.

## Pure Component
- Will render on load and but only when the state is mutated.
